In the former lesson, the major differences between arrays in SaC and arrays in more mainstream languages are explained.

Based on these operations, several small examples demonstrate how more complex array operations can be constructed by simply combining the basic ones."

    "To cope with this problem, in SaC, variables do have a so-called scope, i.e. each variable definition is associated with a well-defined portion of program code where its definition is valid.

This measure allows us to reuse variable names. A slight modification of our example demonstrates the effect of variable scopes in SaC:\n"
